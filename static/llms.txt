PROJECT: Miso - A tastsy Haskell web and mobile framework
WEBSITE: https://haskell-miso.org
REPO: https://github.com/dmjio/miso

DESCRIPTION:
Miso is a small, production-ready, component-oriented, reactive, isomorphic Haskell front-end framework for quickly building highly interactive single-page web and mobile applications. It features a virtual-dom, recursive diffing / patching algorithm, attribute and property normalization, event delegation, event batching, SVG, 2D/3D Canvas (WebGL), Server-sent events (SSE), Websockets, type-safe servant-style routing and an extensible Subscription-based subsystem. Inspired by Elm and React. Miso is pure by default, but side effects can be introduced into the system via the Effect data type.

KEY FEATURES:
- Virtual DOM
- Isomorphic (server-side rendering capable)
- Type-safe and purely functional
- Small bundle size
- Event delegation
- Support for HTML5, SVG, and Web Components

CORE CONCEPTS:
- Model-View-Update (MVU) architecture
- Virtual DOM representation
- Event handling and delegation
- Client-server communication via Fetch, WebSocket and Server Sent Events
- Server-side rendering support

PRIMARY USE CASES:

- Interactive web applications
- Native mobile applications
- Type-safe front-end development
- Full-stack Haskell applications
